## Power Quality Analysis Using Ellipse Fitting and Geometric Algebra Method

### Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the research project titled "Power quality analysis using ellipse fitting and geometric algebra method". Our goal is to innovate in the field of power quality analysis by applying robust ellipse fitting and geometric algebra techniques, addressing the limitations of current methodologies.

### Introduction
Power quality analysis is crucial for the efficient operation of electrical grids. Traditional methods, such as least squares, clustering, and extreme value analysis, often fall short in accurately detecting and characterizing voltage events. This project introduces a new approach, leveraging the power of geometric algebra and ellipse fitting techniques to provide a more accurate, robust analysis of power quality.

### Key Features
- **Geometric Algebra Objects**: Uses the properties of geometric algebra to construct elements that allow the system to be characterised and rotations to be applied more efficiently.
- **Robust Ellipse Fitting**: Employs ellipse fitting methods based in geometric algebra that are more resilient to outliers, providing a reliable analysis of power quality events.
- **Real-world Data Analysis**: Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods using data from actual power grid installations.
